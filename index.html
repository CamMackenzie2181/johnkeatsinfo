                A Biography of John Keats
            </h3>
            <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">
                John Keats (31 October 1795 - 23 February 1821) was an English poet of the second
                generation of Romantic poets, along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. His poems had been in
                publication for less than four years when he died of tuberculosis at the age of 25.
                They were indifferently received in his lifetime, <strong> his fame grew rapidly after his
                    death</strong>. By
                the end of the century, he was placed in the canon of English literature, strongly influencing many
                writers of
                the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; <i>the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica</i> of 1888 described his "Ode to a
                Nightingale" as "one of the final masterpieces". </blockquote>
